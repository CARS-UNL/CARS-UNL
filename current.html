<h3><em>New Perspectives on Geproci-ness</em></h3>
October 26
  <hr>
The geproci property is a recent development in the world of geometry. A set of points is geproci if its projection onto a hyperplane from a general point is a complete intersection. I present new settings for thinking about geproci sets, such as fields of positive characteristic and non-reduced sets of points.

<h3><em>Hilbert function of orbits of D_6 acting on P^2</em></h3>
October 19
  <hr>
I plan on talking about what I have been working on with my advisor Dr. Seceleanu, a.k.a Alexandra.
The idea is to evaluate the Hilbert function (or the Hilbert series) of certain ideals defined in the following way: we start with an action of D_6, Dihedral group of order 6, on the Projective plane, P^2. However, we will really think about this action happening in just k^2. (where k is any field.) The orbits of this action are nice and easy to visualize, with possible orbit sizes being 1,3,6. (exercise, why can't you have an order of size 2 under this action?) We then look at the ideal of a set of n orbits of size 3. The goal is to evaluate the Hilbert function of this ideal which is equivalent to evaluating the Hilbert function of R/I.

  <h3><em>When is Ext Zero?</em></h3>
  October 12
  <hr>
A few weeks ago Matthew defined and gave examples of certain classes of rings. I want to redefine these rings using only Ext.

  <h3>Jorge Gaspar (visiting from CIMAT) </h3>
  <h3><em>Affine Groups and Descent Datum</em></h3>
  October 4
  <hr>
In this talk I will introduce the definition of an affine group from a categorical point of view. We will discuss its connection with schemes and Hopf algebras. Finally, I will talk about descent datum and sketch a proof for a representability criterion of functors.

  <h3><em>What happens when a commutative algebraist tries to do calculus.</em></h3>
  September 28
  <hr>
Given any algebra (over a field or ring), one can define the noncommutative ring of differential operators over that algebra. In most cases we care about as algebraists, this ring is built from partial derivatives. That sounds icky, but fear not my commutatively-inclined friends! The ring of differential operators has interesting structure on its own, and it also has many applications to results in algebra and other fields. Their power comes in their ability to shrink things. To coin a phrase, “Big modules over a ring are small modules over the ring of differential operators.” Today we will introduce the topic and some of those applications, and time permitting prove a classic result in the realm of classical invariant theory.

  <h3><em>What is Local Cohomology?</em></h3>
  September 21
  <hr>
 Often times at a commutative algebra talk the word "local cohomology" is thrown around. When this happens, maybe you think to yourself, "what is that, and why do they say it so often and with such gusto?" Well, I plan to tell you what local cohomology is today. We will start by defining local cohomology via the Čech Complex. Next, we compute a few examples of local cohomology. Finally, if there is time, I want to discuss two very neat uses of local cohomology: depth and arithmetic rank.

  <h3>Matthew Bachmann</h3>
  <h3><em>Classes of Rings from a Geometric perspective</em></h3>
  September 14
  <hr>
 Using the lens of geometry I will present a framework for understanding regular and Cohen-Macaulay rings that relies on two competing notions of dimension. When one notion of dimension is achieved we obtain a CM ring, and the other yields regular rings. Somewhere between these two extremes live complete intersection and Gorenstein rings. I hope to convince you that complete intersections are exactly the rings that satisfy a further condition on the notions of dimension presented at first. Finally, I will attempt the daunting (and probably irresponsible) task of trying to fit Gorenstein rings within this same framework in the short time we have.

  <h3>Nawaj KC</h3>
  <h3><em>What is length?</em></h3>
  September 7
  <hr>
 We provide a partial answer to the question: what does the number <em>length</em>(<em>R/I</em>) measure? In particular, I will try to introduce a very interesting invariant that encodes multiplicities.

  <h3>Julie Geraci</h3>
  <h3><em>A Path to Resolutoins</em></h3>
  August 31
  <hr>
  In this introductory talk we introduce the idea of a path algebra Q and hope to describe a way to attach an infinite sequence of numbers to Q which measure its “growth.” We will then ask: If we know only this sequence of numbers, can we say something meaningful about the quiver that the sequence comes from?
