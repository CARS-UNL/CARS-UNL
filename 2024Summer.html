<h3>  Andrew Soto Levins </h3>
<h3><em>  Gorenstein Dimension, Auslander Bounds, and Vanishing of Tor
 </em></h3>
June 10, 12 and 14 
<hr> 
The Auslander bound of a module can be thought of as a generalization of projective dimension. For a finitely generated module M with finite projective dimension over a Noetherian local ring R, $\ext_{R}^{n}(M,N)=0$ for $n>\pdim_{R}M$ and $\ext_{R}^{\pdim_{R}M}(M,N)\neq 0$. We say that the Auslander bound of M is finite if for all finitely generated modules N such that whenever $\ext_{R}^{n}(M,N)$ for $n\gg 0$, there exists an integer b that only depends on M so that $\ext_{R}^{n}(M,N)=0$ for $n>b$. The Auslander bound is the least such b. 

The goal of these talks is to give an introduction to Gorenstein dimension and Auslander bounds.
 
In the first talk I will define Gorenstein dimension and prove R is Gorenstein if and only if every finitely generated module has finite Gorenstein dimension if and only if the residue field has Gorenstein dimension.
In the second talk I will show that, under certain assumptions, M has finite Gorenstein dimension if it has a finite Auslander bound.
In the third talk I will show how having a finite Auslander bound is related to the vanishing of Tor.
 
My main references are Gorenstein Dimensions by Lars Christensen, my paper A Study on Auslander Bounds, and William Sanders thesis Categorical and homological aspects of module theory over commutative rings."

<h3><em>  Modules of finite projective dimension 
 </em></h3>
June 17, 19 and 21 
<hr> 
I will talk about the objects in the title. Specifically, I want to exposit several proofs of the intersection theorem of Peskine-Szpiro, whatever that is. I know very little about this, but my plan is to learn it with you all during the lectures.  Also, I will mostly focus on the insights and ideas (not that I can handle the details) so my talks will be very informal, somewhat careless, but quite easy.
