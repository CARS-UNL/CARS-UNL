<h3><em> Regularity index of the generalized minimum distance function
 </em></h3>
May 3rd
<hr> 
 We show that the generalized minimum distance function is non-increasing as the degree varies for reduced standard graded algebras over a field. This allows us to define its regularity index and its stabilization value. The stabilization value is computed for every case. We study how the regularity index varies as the number of polynomials increases, and use this to give bounds for it.

<h3>Julie Geraci</h3>
<h3><em>Monomial Resolutions
 </em></h3>
April 26th
<hr> 
 The minimal graded free resolution of a monomial ideal is an invariant that gives algebraic insight into the ideal’s structure. In this talk, I will go over all of the basics along with three approaches for computing resolutions, and compare and contrast these methods. No background knowledge past an introductory course in commutative algebra will be assumed.

<h3><em> Characterizing Gorenstein Local Rings Using the Frobenius Map </em></h3>
April 19th
<hr> 
 For a Noetherian ring R in positive characteristic p, it's well known (and is something that we saw last week) that R is regular if and only if the Frobenius map (taking an element to its pth power) is flat. This week, I'm going to go over a paper by Pinches Dirnfeld that obtains a similar result with respect to Gorenstein rings. To do this, we're going to dive into the world of derived categories and thick subcategories, and then will build up the main result: R is Gorenstein if and only if there exists a R-complex X with finite injective dimension for which the derived base change of X (with respect to the Frobenius) has finite injective dimension

<h3><em> Strongly F-regular rings </em></h3>
April 12th
<hr> 
 In this talk, we will introduce the class of strongly F-regular rings. These are defined via the Frobenius endomorphism on a ring of characteristic p > 0. I will sketch a very pretty proof that shows strongly F-regular rings are Cohen Macaulay.

<h3><em> Enumeration Puzzles in Geometry</em></h3>
April 5th
<hr> 
Do you know how many lines touch four given lines in three-dimensional space? Or how many conics are tangent to five given conics in the plane? Or how many lines touch eight given plane conics in three-dimensional space? Would you like to? Then you are interested in an enumeration puzzle, my friend!
<p>
In this talk, we will be looking at some introductory techniques to help us get started tackling these puzzles. On the way, we will see many neat characters in algebraic geometry like Grassmannians and the Chow ring! We will mostly be following Chapter 3 of Eisenbud and Harris's 3264 & All That Intersection Theory in Algebraic Geometry.

<h3>Kirsten Morris</h3>
<h3><em> An Introduction Algebraic Geometry Codes</em></h3>
March 29th
<hr> 
 In 1977, Valery Denisovich Goppa discovered a relationship between algebraic geometry and codes. In 1982,  Tsfasman, Vladut, and Zink announced a breakthrough result showing that a certain family of algebraic geometry codes exceed the asymptotic Gilbert-Varshamov (GV) bound, implying that algebraic geometry codes can outperform random codes. In this talk I am to provide a fun and friendly introduction to coding theory and algebraic geometry codes in particular. Time permitting I will also share some examples of non-academic job positions or researchers who study these codes.

<h3>Matthew Bachmann</h3>
<h3><em> Resolutions over Complete Intersections</em></h3>
March 22nd
<hr> 
We will discuss the homological properties of modules over complete intersection rings using the ideas developed by Eisenbud in Homological Algebra on a Complete Intersection with an Application to Group Representations. We will explicitly compute the free resolution of a hypersurface ring using Eisenbud’s construction and see that the resolution becomes periodic of period 2. This periodicity naturally leads to the definition of a numerical invariant called the herbrand difference that can be attached to resolutions over hypersurface rings. My research focuses on a generalization of the herbrand difference to complete intersections of codimension greater than 1 and I hope this talk gives you an idea of the kind of problems I work on.

<h3>Jordan Barrett</h3>
<h3><em>Homogeneous Coordinates, Toric Varieties and Zariski-Nagata Type Theorems (a talk by Jordan "Big Boy" Barrett)</em></h3>
March 8rd
<hr> 
 The Zariski-Nagata theorem is a classical result which expresses the nth symbolic power of a radical ideal I in a polynomial ring over a perfect field in terms of the nth regular powers of the maximal ideals in mSpec(I) . In this talk I will discuss projective space and homogeneous coordinates and I will state a well known Zariski-Nagata type theorem for projective varieties. I will also give a brief crash course on toric varieties and generalized homogeneous coordinates and I will discuss my work on developing a Zariski-Nagata theorem for a broader class of toric varieties.

<h3><em>Differential Operators and Local Cohomology</em></h3>
March 1st
<hr> 
Often, when studying local cohomology, one runs into the issue of nonzero local cohmology modules not being finitely generated over the ring of study. In some sense this is because the ring is "too small". However, we can remedy this by considering the ring of differential operators and viewing local cohomology modules as left modules over these new rings. Unfortunately, there is a catch; the ring of differential operators is generally not commutative. In this talk, we will introduce differential operators and discuss how we can leverage this non-commutative ring in the study of local cohomology.

<h3><em>An Interesting Proof in Dimension Zero</em></h3>
February 22nd
<hr> 
Recently I saw an interesting proof in dimension zero in the paper "On the finiteness of the Gorenstein dimension for Artin algebras" by Rene Marczinzik (https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07463). In this talk, I want to take you on a journey into the uncharted territory of the not necessarily commutative rings, also known as noncommutative algebra (also known as the danger zone).

<h3>Frank Zimmitti</h3>
<h3><em>Bezout's theorem in higher dimensions</em></h3>
February 15th
<hr> 
Bezout's theorem is a famous result in projective geometry which allows you to compute the number of points of intersection of two curves in the projective plane. With some work, this result generalizes nicely to intersections of varieties in higher dimensional projective spaces. We will briefly discuss the classical version of Bezout's theorem and introduce some fundamental ideas in algebraic geometry in order to be able to state the theorem for projective spaces of any dimension. No advanced knowledge of algebraic geometry will be assumed.

<h3><em>Bernstein’s Inequality for Certain Singular Rings</em></h3>
February 8th
<hr> 
Bernstein’s Inequality is a classic result of Joseph Bernstein (also spelled I. N. Bernstein) about D-modules: If M is a module over the ring of differential operators on a polynomial ring in n variables, then the dimension of M is at least n and no more than 2n. In this talk, we will see some of the work that I have done with Jack Jeffries to prove this result for some non-polynomial (aka singular) rings. In particular we will see that the inequality holds for D-modules of the degree 2 Veronese subring of K[x,y]. No advanced algebraic knowledge will be required, but a good disposition and a can-do attitude will be useful skills for learning something new from this talk.
