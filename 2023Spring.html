<h3> Andrew Soto </h3>
<h3><em>  What is local cohomology?
 </em></h3>
September 7 
<hr> 
  Recently I started learning about local cohomology and I think it is interesting. In this talk I will define local cohomology and go over the first few facts that I learned.
</div>

<h3>Nawaj KC </h3>
<h3><em>What is \mathbb{Q}?
 </em></h3>
September 14
<hr> 
Clearly, rational numbers are god's gift to humanity. But why? I want to make a humble attempt at an answer to this question. I will discuss certain topologies on \mathbb{Q} and how that leads us to the brave new world of mixed characteristic commutative algebra.

<h3>Taylor Murray</h3>
<h3><em> Injective Dimension of Big Modules </em></h3>
September 21 
<hr> 
Injective modules, the dual notion of projective modules, show up all over commutative algebra. Unlike projective modules, injective modules are rarely finitely generated. Despite this, when R is Noetherian we can decompose injective modules into smaller, nicer injective modules called injective hulls. In this talk I will introduce the concept of injective modules, injective hulls, and the aforementioned decomposition theorem. After that, we will define injective dimension, and, if time permits, survey a few results in the literature of injective dimensions of very big modules.

<h3>Jordan Barret KC</h3>
<h3><em> Abstract Toric Varieties & Zariski-Nagata Type Theorems (Or: Spring of Artifice)  </em></h3>
September 28
<hr> 
The Zariski-Nagata theorem is a classical result which expresses the nth symbolic power of a radical ideal I in a polynomial ring over a perfect field in terms of the nth regular powers of the maximal ideals in mSpec(I) . In this talk I will give the necessary background to state a well known Zariski-Nagata type theorem for projective varieties. I will also give a brief crash course on toric varieties and generalized homogeneous coordinates and I will discuss my work on developing an analogous Zariski-Nagata theorem for a broader class of toric varieties.

<h3>Jake Kettinger</h3>
<h3><em> Enumeration Puzzles in Geometry</em></h3>
April 5th
<hr> 
Do you know how many lines touch four given lines in three-dimensional space? Or how many conics are tangent to five given conics in the plane? Or how many lines touch eight given plane conics in three-dimensional space? Would you like to? Then you are interested in an enumeration puzzle, my friend!
<p>
In this talk, we will be looking at some introductory techniques to help us get started tackling these puzzles. On the way, we will see many neat characters in algebraic geometry like Grassmannians and the Chow ring! We will mostly be following Chapter 3 of Eisenbud and Harris's 3264 & All That Intersection Theory in Algebraic Geometry.

<h3>Kirsten Morris</h3>
<h3><em> An Introduction Algebraic Geometry Codes</em></h3>
March 29th
<hr> 
 In 1977, Valery Denisovich Goppa discovered a relationship between algebraic geometry and codes. In 1982,  Tsfasman, Vladut, and Zink announced a breakthrough result showing that a certain family of algebraic geometry codes exceed the asymptotic Gilbert-Varshamov (GV) bound, implying that algebraic geometry codes can outperform random codes. In this talk I am to provide a fun and friendly introduction to coding theory and algebraic geometry codes in particular. Time permitting I will also share some examples of non-academic job positions or researchers who study these codes.

<h3>Matthew Bachmann</h3>
<h3><em> Resolutions over Complete Intersections</em></h3>
March 22nd
<hr> 
We will discuss the homological properties of modules over complete intersection rings using the ideas developed by Eisenbud in Homological Algebra on a Complete Intersection with an Application to Group Representations. We will explicitly compute the free resolution of a hypersurface ring using Eisenbudâ€™s construction and see that the resolution becomes periodic of period 2. This periodicity naturally leads to the definition of a numerical invariant called the herbrand difference that can be attached to resolutions over hypersurface rings. My research focuses on a generalization of the herbrand difference to complete intersections of codimension greater than 1 and I hope this talk gives you an idea of the kind of problems I work on.

<h3><em>Homogeneous Coordinates, Toric Varieties and Zariski-Nagata Type Theorems (a talk by Jordan "Big Boy" Barrett)</em></h3>
March 8rd
