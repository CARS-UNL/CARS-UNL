	<h3>Andrew Soto-Levins</h3>
	<h3><em> What is local cohomology? </em></h3>
	September 7th
	<hr>
  Abstract:  Recently I started learning about local cohomology and I think it is interesting. In this talk I will define local cohomology and go over the first few facts that I learned.

	<h3><em> What is \mathbb{Q}?  </em></h3>
	September 14th
	<hr>
  Abstract:  Clearly, rational numbers are god's gift to humanity. But why? I want to make a humble attempt at an answer to this question. I will discuss certain topologies on \mathbb{Q} and how that leads us to the brave new world of mixed characteristic commutative algebra.

	<h3><em> Abstract Toric Varieties & Zariski-Nagata Type Theorems (Or: Spring of Artifice)  </em></h3>
	September 28th
	<hr>
  Abstract:  The Zariski-Nagata theorem is a classical result which expresses the nth symbolic power of a radical ideal I in a polynomial ring over a perfect field in terms of the nth regular powers of the maximal ideals in mSpec(I) . In this talk I will give the necessary background to state a well known Zariski-Nagata type theorem for projective varieties. I will also give a brief crash course on toric varieties and generalized homogeneous coordinates and I will discuss my work on developing an analogous Zariski-Nagata theorem for a broader class of toric varieties.

	<h3>Anne Fayolle from the University of Utah</h3>
	<h3><em> Compatible ideals and their behavior under finite covers  </em></h3>
	October 5th
	<hr>
	Abstract: In this talk, I will review compatible ideals, a fundamental part of the theory of F-singularities. I will then explain how one can study how these behave under finite covers by linking them to tame ramification. This is joint work with Javier Carvajal-Rojas.

	<h3>Peter McDonald from the University of Utah</h3>
	<h3><em>Singularities in characteristic zero: splinters, multiplier ideals, and closure operations </em></h3>
	October 12th
	<hr>
Abstract: In this talk, I’ll discuss ways of using so-called splinter properties to classify singularities in characteristic zero. As part of this, I’ll introduce the multiplier ideal and klt singularities, characteristic zero analogs of test ideals and strongly F-regular singularities and talk about a recent result that gives a (derived) splinter characterization of klt singularities via a new description of the multiplier ideal. This result has applications to the study of closure operations in characteristic zero, via joint work with Epstein, R.G., and Schwede.

	<h3><em> Gorenstein Differential Graded Algebras  </em></h3>
	October 19th
	<hr>
Abstract: The following abstract is for my comp talk, which I'll be giving in CARS this week for practice. However, I can spend more time in CARS going over concepts and answering questions, so it hopefully won't be the exact same as my actual comp talk.
In homological algebra, a fundamental object of study is a chain complex of modules over a ring. Since chain complexes consist of modules, there is no natural multiplicative structure on these objects. In order to endow chain complexes with a multiplicative structure, it's necessary to define a differential graded algebra (DGA) and differential graded modules over DGAs. In my talk, I'll be going over some basic properties of DGAs and their associated DG-modules, and will generalize the concept of a Gorenstein ring to define a Gorenstein DGA. I'll then sketch a result of Frankild, Iyengar, and Jorgensen that characterizes finite local Gorenstein DGAs using the behavior of Ext.

	<h3><em> The Power of Symbolic Powers in Commutative Algebra </em></h3>
	October 25th
	<hr>
Abstract: I will review primary decomposition as a motivation for defining symbolic powers of ideals. I hope to convince you that symbolic powers are often different from ordinary powers and also are much cooler in part because they contain geometric information.

	<h3>Wolfgang Allred</h3>
	<h3><em>Differential Geometry Through Commutative Algebra and Observables</em></h3>
	November 2nd
	<hr>
Abstract: As researchers in mathematics we are often siloed away in our own areas, and it can be intimidating to learn all the technical machinery of fields that we might be interested but perhaps don’t have the time to investigate. But sometimes we can learn about new things in terms that we are already familiar with, and hopefully bring about new insights in doing so. In this talk I will discuss how differential geometry can be phrased in the language of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, and how this connection relates to ideas from physics.

	<h3>Stephen Stern</h3>
	<h3><em>Edge Ideals, Cover Ideals, and Alexander Duality</em></h3>
	November 8th
	<hr>
Abstract: Buckle your seatbelts, we’re doing some combinatorics. In commutative algebra, (square-free) monomial ideals often appear as a first, simple example of a definition or concept. In these cases, the algebraic behavior of interest can usually be described by the combinatorics of the minimal generators. In this talk, I’ll introduce a three-way bijective correspondence between square-free monomial ideals and two different combinatorial objects that may prove useful in answering algebraic questions. For a first example I will characterize the unique minimal primary decomposition of square-free monomial ideals. As time allows, I will introduce other interplays between combinatorics and algebra in this setting. In short, I hope to convince you that square-free monomial ideals are interesting in their own right, more than just as simple examples, and by the end the picture below will give you a chuckle.

	<h3><em> When are rings of invariants...?</em></h3>
	November 15th
	<hr>
Abstract: This talk will give an overview of finite group invariant theory, where we will learn some classical theorems along the way. The goal of this talk is to answer some questions of the form "When are rings of invariants [insert desired algebraic property here]?"

	<h3><em> Interpolation in the weighted projective space</em></h3>
	December 6th
	<hr>
Abstract:  Given a finite set of points $X$ in the projective space over a field $k$ one can ask for the $k$-vector space dimension of all degree $d$ polynomials that vanish to order two on $X$. (These are polynomials whose first derivative vanishes on $X$.) The Alexander-Hirschowitz theorem (A-H) computes this dimension in terms of the multiplicity of the points and the $k$-vector space dimension of degree $d$ monomials, with finitely many exceptions. In this talk, we investigate this question in the weighted projective line and space, $\mathbb{P}(s,t)$ and $\mathbb{P}(a,b,c)$. We define a notion of multiplicity for weighted spaces, give an example of $\mathbb{P}(a,b,c)$ where A-H holds with no exceptions and an infinite family where A-H fails for even one point, and discuss future directions.
